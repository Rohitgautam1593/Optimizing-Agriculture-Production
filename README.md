# Optimizing Agricultural Production

## About the Project

This project aims to optimize agricultural production using data-driven insights and machine learning. It includes a web application that suggests suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions, and provides visualizations of the dataset and model performance.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **Optimizing Agricultural Production-2.ipynb**: The main notebook used for core data analysis, model training, and feature development.
- **Optimizing Agricultural Production.ipynb**: A secondary notebook used for testing new ideas and adding experimental features.

### Web Application

The web app is built with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It provides:

- Dataset summary and condition distributions
- Crop statistics and condition comparisons
- Crop suggestion prediction based on user input
- Model accuracy and confusion matrix visualization

## Getting Started

1. Install required Python packages (Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
2. Run the Flask app (`app.py`) to start the web server.
3. Open the web app in a browser to interact with the features.
